	abstract = {A sorting algorithm is adaptive if it sorts sequences that are close to sorted faster than random sequences, where the distance is determined by some measure of presortedness. Over the years several measures of presortedness have been proposed in the literature, but it has been far from clear how they relate to each other. We show that there exists a natural partial order on the set of measures, which makes it possible to say that some measures are superior to others. We insert all known measures of presortedness into the partial order, and thereby provide a powerful tool for evaluating both measures and adaptive sorting algorithms. We further present a new measure and show that it is a maximal element in the partial order formed by all known measures, and thus that any sorting algorithm that optimally adapts to the new measure also optimally adapts to all other known measures of presortedness. We have not succeeded in developing an optimal algorithm for the new measure; however, we present one that is optimal in terms of comparisons.},

Efforts in the past to find an efficient method for solving it have met with only partial success. The present paper describes a method of solution that has the following properties: (a) It is applicable to both symmetric and asymmetric problems with random elements. (b) It does not use subjective decisions, so that it can be completely mechanized. (c) It is appreciably faster than any other method proposed. (d) It can be terminated at any point where the solution obtained so far is deemed sufficiently accurate.},

  abstract = {{Modern population genomic datasets hold immense promise for revealing the evolutionary processes operating in natural populations, but a crucial prerequisite for this goal is the ability to model realistic evolutionary scenarios and predict their expected patterns in genomic data. To that end, we present SLiM 2: an evolutionary simulation framework that combines a powerful, fast engine for forward population genetic simulations with the capability of modeling a wide variety of complex evolutionary scenarios. SLiM achieves this flexibility through scriptability, which provides control over most aspects of the simulated evolutionary scenarios with a simple R-like scripting language called Eidos. An example SLiM simulation is presented to illustrate the power of this approach. SLiM 2 also includes a graphical user interface for simulation construction, interactive runtime control, and dynamic visualization of simulation output, facilitating easy and fast model development with quick prototyping and visual debugging. We conclude with a performance comparison between SLiM and two other popular forward genetic simulation packages.}},
